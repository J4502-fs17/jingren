  <p>A newsboy was standing on the corner with a stack of papers, yelling, "Read all about it. Fifty people swindled! Fifty people swindled!"
     Curious, a man walked over, bought a paper, and checked the front page. Finding nothing, the man said, "There's nothing in here about fifty people being swindled."
     The newsboy ignored him and went on, calling out, "Read all about it. Fifty-one people swindled!"</p>
